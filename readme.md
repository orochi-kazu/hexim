# Hexim

A friendly-but-still-competitive multiplayer game that feels like a European-style boardgame.

## High-level gameplay

The game is divided into rounds, with two phases each.
Play ends after the round that the board becomes filled.

The first phase in a round is tile placement:
players draw tiles and place them, one at a time, on the board.

The second phase is an individually-played minigame per region.

The size of a region affects the number of turns in the minigame,
and plays in the minigame affect the region's production.
