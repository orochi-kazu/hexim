# Roadmap

In the interests of delivering working software often, with an incorporated feedback cycle,
delivery is intended to proceed in milestone phases.

## Milestone 1: minimum viable product (MVP)

A barebones playtest game, restricted to a single browser session, with hot-seat multiplayer.

See [MVP feature checklist](./roadmap/01_mvp.md) for more specific details.

## Milestone 2: alpha (soft-launch)

Additions:

- publicly deployed and accessible;
- local storage, for session safety;
- basic tutorial;
- audio (music and other sounds);
- mid-level graphics;
- gameplay tuning; and
- feedback mechanism.

Feedback facility will be publicised in-game.

See [alpha feature checklist](./roadmap/02_alpha.md) for more specific details.

## Milestone 3: beta

Additions:

- online-multiplayer (!);
- fleshed out tutorial;
- final audio and graphics; and
- gameplay tuning.

Minimal marketing effort to build community interest.

See [beta feature checklist](./roadmap/03_beta.md) for more specific details.

## Milestone 4: hard launch

Harder marketing push to build community interest.

## Post-launch expansion ideas

- Translation (localisation and internationalisation)
- Computer-controlled players
- In-game matchmaking
- Offline mode (PWA)
- Player account management (change device, track history, etc)
- Non-web platform support
  - Mobile
  - Console
- Modding support
- Community game clients
